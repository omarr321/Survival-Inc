# Survival-Inc.
## Description
A game where you wake up on another planet and you must survive using only
your wits. Remember that trees make everything and lava is dangerous.
### What?
Survival Inc. is a game that mixes Minecraft with Terarria in a top-down environment.
A player can explore different maps in the world and collect resources for crafting.
Environments are randomly generated with different entities and tile decorations for terrain.
### Why?
Because the concepts we've learned about in CS2 such as object orientation and inheritance can be
applied to a 2D game where instances of classes represent physical objects in the game. We also wanted
to be creative with our project and games give us that scalability.
### How?
We are using javaFX for graphics and front-end operations. Back-end will utilize programming
concepts such as classes, polymorphism, inheritance, and more.
## Delivarables
1. The core engine for the game that structures physical objects as entities
with an entity / map binding system.
2. The player mechanics and to use methods from the engine in order to make the player work
with the front-end
3. Front-end code must use methods from Map and Entity classes to determine graphics
to be rendered into screen. It must also instantiate the player with kayboard controls.
## Plan
* Week 1 (March 3 - March 10)
	1. Finish setting up repository
	2. Discuss the overall game concept in better detail
* Week 2 (March 10 - March 17)
	1. Layout UML using visual graph editor.
	2. Establish front-end and back-end relationship for final integration.
* Week 3 (March 17 - March 24)
	1. Back-end development begins. Map and Abstract class for entity should have core methods.
	2. Front-end development begins. JavaFX grid should be laid out and should call methods
	described in the UML
* Week 4 (March 24 - March 31)
	1. Back-end should create sub-classes for entities and program their properties.
	2. Player controls and entity should be worked on for integration
* Week 5 (March 31 - April 7)
	1. Final integration of back-end and front-end.
	2. Make sure all graphics and GUI are updating from back-end
	3. Polish game for final presentation.
